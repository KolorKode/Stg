What is in this directory ?

This repository contains most of the free tools that I have developed over the years.

I've trimmed the fat and not included a lot of the junk that people don't use anymore.


gen_dosomething - http://www.oddsock.org/tools/dosomething - This app is really not maintained anymore.
gen_songrequester - http://www.oddsock.org/tools/gen_songrequester - Again, not really maintained.
ml_sclist - http://www.oddsock.org/tools/ml_sclist - Media Library Shoutcast plugin (simpler than their new one).
ml_icecastlist - http://www.oddsock.org/tools/ml_icecastlist - Winamp Media Library Plugin for Icecast Directory
edcast - the broadcaster-previously-known-as-oddcast
edcast_jack - The edcast jack client
streamTranscoderv3 - Transcode streams from one server to another.

Other stuff:

libedcast - This is a library used by edcast/stream transcoder for most of the heavy work.

m4 - Another svn:external for the tools that have linux builds.
