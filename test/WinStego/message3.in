                    Higher Education in The U.K.

     There are more than 60  universities  in  the  U.K.  The  leading
universities are Cambridge, Oxford and  London.  English  universities
differ from each other in traditions, general  organization,  internal
goverment, etc. British  universities  are  comparatively  small,  the
approximate number is about 7-8 thousand students.  Most  universities
have under 3000 students, some even less than 1500  ones.  London  and
Oxford universities are international, because people from  many parts
of the world come to study at one  of  their  colleges.  A  number  of
wellknown scientists and writers, among  them  Newton,  Darvin,  Byron
were educated in Cambridge.
     A university consists of  a  number  of  departments:  art,  law,
music, economy, education, medicine, engineering, etc.
     After three years of study a student may proceed to  a Bachelor's
degree, and later  to  the  degrees  of  Master  and  Doctor.  Besides
universities there are at present in Britain 300  technical  colleges,
providing part-time and full-time education.
     The organization system of Oxford and Cambridge differs from that
of all other universities  and  colleges.  The  teachers  are  usually
called Dons. Part of the teaching is by means of lectures organized by
the university. Teaching is also carried out by tutorial  system. This
is the system of individual tuitio organized  by  the  colleges.  Each
student goes to his tutor's room once a week to read  and  discuss  an
essay which the student has prepared.
     Some students get scholarship but the number of these students is
comparatively small. There are many sociaties and clubs  at  Cambridge
and Oxford. The most celebrating at Cambridge is the  Debating Sociaty
at which students discuss political and other  questions  with  famous
politicians and writers. Sporting activities are also numerous.
     The work and games, the traditions and  customs,  the  jokes  and
debates - all are parts of students' life there.
     It  should  be  mentioned  that  not  many  children   from   the
working-class families are able to receive the higher education as the
fees are very high (more than L1000 a year). Besides that special fees
are taken for books, for laboratory works, exams and so on.
